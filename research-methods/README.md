- Looking for aspects of existing sustainable cities that are admired by others for their success. This will help me decide what details to include in my sustainable city.

- More examples of systems implemented into green infustructure that have been succesful (specifically in gardens which will be easy for me to recreate visually). Also terminology that I should become familiar with.

- I decided that insead of printing my images on fabric and hanging them in an installation I would build a folding room divider with six panels and paint my image directly onto the wood. I am going to focus on the proposal for now but I might start the physical project if I can access the materials in time. This is an example of a painted room divider at the Art Institute.
